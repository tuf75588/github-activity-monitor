# Github Activity monitor by Andrew Davis

## A Single page React application recreating the GitHub profile page.  

The inspiration for this application came from GitHub having recently introduced a public GraphQL API to the public and my desire to strengthen my understanding with the REST alternative to build front end web applications.

## Software used
* Netlify Auth Providers for Authentication
* Emotion
* Reach Router
* Graphql-Request
* date-fns


### Todos

- [x] Bring in necessary dependencies
- [x] Create a basic home page
- [x] Establish Connection with Gihtub GraphQL API via graphql-request
- [x] Establish Authentication via react-netlify-identity
